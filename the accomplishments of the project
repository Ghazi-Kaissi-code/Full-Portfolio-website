Back-end Developer (Ghazi Kaissi):

My supervisor, MOHAMMAD AL ABED, told me that I need to prepare an introduction about PHP PDO to better understand the concept I will be working on.

My first task includes researching the differences between MySQL, MySQLi, and PDO.

Why do we need to use PHP PDO? What are the benefits of using it?

He mentioned that we have a CMS project for supervision tasks, and its concept covers 80% of the main project we need to complete (LMS).

I realized that the CMS project using PHP PDO includes object-oriented programming (OOP), functions, security, and protection against SQL injections.

For task 2:

I need to create PHP PDO code that inserts and fetches data for the navbar, hero section, and services. I encountered an issue when using fetchAll()

without adding htmlspecialchars(), which caused an error during runtime. After adding it to my code, everything ran successfully.
