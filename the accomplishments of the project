Back-end dev (Ghazi Kaissi):
My superviser MOHAMMAD AL ABED told me that I have to do an introduction about PHP PDO to better understand the concept that i have to work on it.
My first task include to do a search about the difference betweeen MYSQL , MYSQLI and PDO . 
Why we have to use PHP PDO ? What is the bennefits for using it ? 
He told me that we have a CMS project for the supervision tasks and his concept covert 80% for the main project that we have to do (LMS).
I realise after all this that the CMS project using PHP PDO contain oop programming , functions,security and MYSQL injections...
